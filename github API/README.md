This is my repository for the githup API interogation and visualization of data.
I managed to successfully full data from the data base However *** 
I did not manage to visualize that data so I have just visualized 
static json data.
In order to run the data retrieval simply run in the home directory "stack run (github username) (name) (token)"
In order to show the static visualization you should go to the /yesod folder and run stack run
